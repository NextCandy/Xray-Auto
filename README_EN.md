## ✨ Features

* **📦 Modular Design**: The code is logically organized into three main modules: Core, Lib, and Tools.
* **🔒 Latest Protocols**: Supports Vision and XHTTP protocols with integrated Reality masking.
* **🛡️ Security Hardening**: Automatically configures Fail2ban and the Firewall.
* **🛠️ Rich Toolbox**: Built-in tools for WARP, BBR, port management, SNI optimization, and more.


## 📋 Requirements

* **OS**: Debian 10+, Ubuntu 20.04+ (Debian 11/12 recommended)
* **Architecture**: amd64, arm64
* **Permissions**: `root` access required
* **Ports**: Uses high random ports by default (for Vision and XHTTP).
* **Client**: Ensure your client supports these protocols (e.g., Shadowrocket, v2rayN, etc.)


## 📥 Quick Start

### 🚀 Recommended: One-Click Installation (Bootstrap)

Run the following command as the `root` user. The bootstrap script will automatically install Git, clone the repository, and start the installer.

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ISFZY/Xray-Auto/main/bootstrap.sh)

```

### 🛠️ Alternative: Manual Installation
If you cannot connect to GitHub Raw, you can try cloning manually:

```bash
# 1. Install Git
apt update && apt install -y git

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ISFZY/Xray-Auto.git xray-install

# 3. Run the script
cd xray-install
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

```


## 🗑️ Uninstall

If you want to completely remove Xray and its related configurations, run the following (or type remove in the server terminal):

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ISFZY/Xray-Auto/main/tools/remove.sh)

```
**📥 Lite Installation (lite.sh)**
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ISFZY/Xray-Auto/main/lite.sh)

```
